## 0x251 The Bigger Picture

The binary a.out’s instructions are
written in machine language, an elementary language the CPU can under-
stand. Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into machine
language for a variety of processor architectures. In this case, the processor
is in a family that uses the x86 architecture. There are also Sparc processor
architectures (used in Sun Workstations) and the PowerPC processor arch-
itecture (used in pre-Intel Macs).

Each architecture has a different machine
language, so the compiler acts as a middle ground—translating C code into
machine language for the target architecture.

Basely in "The Art of Exploitation" CPU Architecture used is `x86` but in my case i use a next gen PC in `x64`

If you be attentive you can remark that here it's x64 registers who are used .
