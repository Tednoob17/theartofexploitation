## 0x251 The Bigger Picture

The binary a.outâ€™s instructions are
written in machine language, an elementary language the CPU can under-
stand. Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into machine
language for a variety of processor architectures. In this case, the processor
is in a family that uses the x86 architecture. There are also Sparc processor
architectures (used in Sun Workstations) and the PowerPC processor arch-
itecture (used in pre-Intel Macs).
