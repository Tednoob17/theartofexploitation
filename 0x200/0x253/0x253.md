## 0x253 Assembly Language

Here we using `Intel` Synthax ,he is presented like this :

`operation <destination>,  <source>`

The destination and source values will either be a register, a memory address, or a value.
The operations are usually intuitive mnemonics: The mov
operation will move a value from the source to the destination, sub will subtract, inc will increment, and so forth.


Ex :
- (in gdb)
```asm
0x000055555555514e <+5>:	mov    rbp, rsp
0x0000555555555151 <+8>:	sub    rsp, $0x10
```
- (with gdb)
```asm
114e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
1151:	48 83 ec 10          	sub    rsp,0x10
```

There are also operations that are used to control the flow of execution.
The cmp operation is used to compare values, and basically any operation beginning with j is used to jump to a different part of the code (depending on the result of the comparison).


```asm
```
